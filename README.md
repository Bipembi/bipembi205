A-Frame Table Scene
This project is an interactive 3D scene built using A-Frame, a web framework for building virtual reality (VR) experiences. The scene contains a house structure with walls, a ceiling, and a floor, as well as furniture like a table and chairs. Additionally, there are everyday items placed on the table, such as Milo and Milk tins, and cups.

Features:
Environment: The scene features a background sky (green or custom image) and a ground plane.
House Structure: A simple house with a black back wall, brown side walls, a ceiling, and a flat floor.
Furniture: A table with a textured top and four legs, along with two chairs surrounding the table.
Items: Milo tin, Milk tin, and cups placed on the table.
Technologies Used:
A-Frame: Used for creating the 3D scene.
HTML: Structure of the web page.
JavaScript: For managing interactivity (A-Frame uses JavaScript for its scene management).
